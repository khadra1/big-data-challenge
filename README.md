## Big Data - Extract Transform Load - Amazon Shoppers Reviews
### Many of Amazon's shoppers depend on product reviews to make a purchase. Amazon makes these datasets publicly available. They are quite large and can exceed the capacity of local machines. One dataset alone contains over 1.5 million rows; with over 40 datasets, data analysis can be very demanding on the average local computer.
I chose two datasets from Amazon's list of Reviews datasets at https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt:

** Digital Music Reviews
** Digital Video Games Reviews

For the first level I created a bucket on Amazon AWS where I uploaded the above datasets so I could perform ETL on both of them.
